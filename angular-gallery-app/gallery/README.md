# Gallery

I. This repository contains a gallery app created using AngularJS.

II. Special thanks to Wes Doyle, 'Angular 4 Tutorial - Photo Gallery App" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5-CIZTLyvw), for the tutorial to follow along with.

III. The app is live at : https://stark-escarpment-72668.herokuapp.com/gallery

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
